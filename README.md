Simon Says for the Arduino Uno
I will upload a schematic when I have more time. For now please look at the top of SimonSays source code and connect the pins to the
port numbers I assigned or simply change the pin values to what you prefer.

This is currently still in development
It only has 10 levels.  To increase or decrease it, change the LevelMax variable.

I plan on  adding sound when i get the time and also a start button.

Requirements:

1.) My custom vector lib for the Arduino: https://github.com/IsemanTech/cVector

2.) A simple lib I made that makes assigning leds to push buttons less cumbersome: 
https://github.com/IsemanTech/Arduino-EasyIO


I will include these in a lib directory when I have time
