Simon Says for the Arduino Uno
I will upload a schematic when I have more time. For now please look at the top of SimonSays source code and connect the pins to the
port numbers I assigned or simply change the pin values to what you prefer.

This is currently still in development
It only has 1 level called "levelMax" to set how many leds will light up in one stage for now. I will make more stages.

Requirements:

1.) My custom vector lib for the Arduino: https://github.com/IsemanTech/cVector

2.) A simple lib I made that makes assigning leds to push buttons less cumbersome: 
https://github.com/IsemanTech/Arduino-EasyIO


I will include these in a lib directory when I have time
